The following note book is a machine learing CNN model using PyTorch to label the direction of eyes in images. 
It uses the open source data from the eye-dataset on kaggle posted by kayvanshah. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kayvanshah/eye-dataset

The original intent for the dataset was for automating an wheelchair, but we are repurposing it for future uses in eye tracking.

The data consists of four folder and comprising a total of 14.5k images with the labels: 
close_look : images of closed eye,
left_look : images of eye looking at left,
right_look : images of eye looking at right,
forward_look : images of eye looking straight.
